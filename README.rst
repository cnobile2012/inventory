Current Status of Project
=========================

The major updates on this package, as of late October 2016, have been
progressing very well. Most of the database and RESTful API work is completed
and unittests are now being updated and coverage should be going up
accordingly.

Expect to see frontend work starting within the next few months.

All new development is being done in the develop branch and will eventually be
rebased into the master branch.
